## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the JetTracker organization on GitHub, an open-source-orientated flight and C02 emission tracking organization ✈️. By making CO2 emission data publicly available, 
we hope to make it easier for the general public to hold big polluters accountable and, in doing so, fight climate change 🌍. 

- :person_fencing: We are dedicated to fighting climate change via OS. Therefore, most of our code is publicly available under an MIT license.
- 🙋‍♀️ We are a community-based project that is open to all people, ideas and contributions.
- 🌍 We love to connect and collaborate with journalists, developers and other organizations fighting climate change.

### How to contribute

All of our repositories, except the Web Application, are publicly available. You can, therefore, easily contribute to the cause by:

- Report bugs.
- Creating pull requests. 
- Discussing the current state of the project.
- Submitting fixes.
- Proposing new features.

If you are interested in helping or want to know more about us, please hop into our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/EhVPmRK7P4) 🧙.
